# Dashboard for thispersondoesnotexist

## Purpose

To infer metadata properties about the dataset used to train thispersondoesnotexist. I'm interested in knowing the distribution of gender, age and ethnicity in the dataset. By sampling and classifying images I can get a sense of what the training data was like.

## Implementation

The code to pull the image will be in Python and the analysis will be done in R.
